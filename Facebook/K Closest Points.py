Given some points and a point origin in two dimensional space, find k points out
of the some points which are nearest to origin.
Return these points sorted by distance, if they are same with distance, sorted by
x-axis, otherwise sorted by y-axis.

Have you met this question in a real interview?
Example
Given points = [[4,6],[4,7],[4,4],[2,5],[1,1]], origin = [0, 0], k = 3
return [[1,1],[2,5],[4,4]]
